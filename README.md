This project helped me to consolidate knowledge on React fundamentals like:
 - Components 
 - State
 - Props

I had to develop three functions on this app:
 - Add new task
 - Check task completed
 - Delete task

The tests was made by Rocketseat team, and the grade was gave by Rocketseat's platform!
