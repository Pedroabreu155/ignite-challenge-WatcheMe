This project helped me to consolidate knowledge on React fundamentals like:
 - Components 
 - Context
 - Props
 - Hooks

I learned about Typescript types, interfaces and how to type objects and function returns and params 

I had to refactor the code on:
 - Isolate components
 - Create context to share states through the app
 - Organize styles inside the folders

The tests was made by Rocketseat team, and the grade was gave by Rocketseat's platform!
